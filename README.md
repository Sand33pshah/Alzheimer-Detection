## Overview

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project leverages data science and machine learning to analyze relevant datasets and build predictive models for Alzheimer's detection.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization tools
- Multiple machine learning models for classification
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Modular and extensible codebase

## Main ML Code Snippets

The core of the project is implemented in Jupyter notebooks. Below are representative code snippets for the main processes:

**1. Checking and Handling Missing Values**
```python
# Check missing values by each column
pd.isnull(df).sum() 
# The column 'SES' has 8 missing values

# Remove rows with missing values
df_dropna = df.dropna(axis=0, how='any')
pd.isnull(df_dropna).sum()
```
([See source in notebook](https://github.com/Sand33pshah/Alzheimer-Detection/blob/6cd84c696a01ad50c7147c0b30fc3f90e1b69cc4/detecting_early_alzheimer.ipynb#L595-L696))

**2. Machine Learning Algorithm Example**
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Setup and fit Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```
> Note: The project uses scikit-learn's Logistic Regression for classification. You may see convergence warnings; consider increasing `max_iter` or scaling your data.

## Data Handling & Missing Values

- The dataset was checked for missing values using `pd.isnull(df).sum()`.
- The column with missing data (`SES`) had 8 missing entries.
- These rows were removed with `df.dropna(axis=0, how='any')` for model integrity.
- After this step, all columns had 0 missing values, ensuring robust training and evaluation.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sand33pshah/Alzheimer-Detection.git
   cd Alzheimer-Detection
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset according to the instructions in the [data](./data/) directory (if applicable).
2. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   or open and run `detecting_early_alzheimer.ipynb` in Jupyter.

3. Review results and metrics output in the console or as generated plots.
